My block diagram showcasing the simplified individual components my subsystem uses, including a switching voltage regulator, wall mounted power supply, a microcontroller, a motor driver, and an actuator. The specifics will be provided within my [component selection](https://jmfran17.github.io/Jack_Datasheet.github.io/second-page/).
